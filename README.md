# Presentation Notes

## Intro (Julia)
- Why we chose this design
- Goals of the site
- Modernize the website - website is your biggest marketing tool, so if you don’t have a modern website it won’t attract students

## ACT 1: Wireframing (Julia)
- Started with a basic wireframe but then we chose a theme that didn’t follow our wireframe structure so we just went with that
- How did we look for themes? -> Searched for themes that would be appropriate for an educational institution
- Main design goals were still followed even though original wireframe design wasn't 100% used

## ACT 2: How we chose the content (Lord)
- Original website had too much content
- We chose the most important things out of top level menu, that the user/student might be looking for. 
- Pitch: With a real client, would have to go through site architecture and talk about what to keep

## ACT 3: Wordpress features (Lord)
- Theme: Education X
- Features: Plugin to add courses, events

## Epilogue (Lord)
- Restate the goal/call to action
