•	task: redesign the website for macewan university. 
•	The main goals 
o	learn more about MacEwan and encourage them to attend the university. 
o	more inviting so students will spend more time on the site learning   
•	biggest thing for us was 
o	modernize the design 
o	main marketing tool of a university. 
o	young people the main way of finding information is online.
o	impression that MacEwan has modern programs and facilities so students will want to attend, up-to-date education. 
•	To update the look, we 
o	updated the colors, engaging and visually appealing, 
o	used a hero image across the pages
•	and made the site more responsive on devices of various sizes. 
o	Responsiveness is really important, current site is not responsive 
o	students using mobile devices, may leave the site quickly if it is not easy to use, and they may move on to other university websites.
•	wireframing/design choices
o	so getting into our design process…
o	while wireframing, our basic design concept included
	large hero section across each of the pages, as that is a trend
	one simplified menu at the top, highlight most important content that students may be looking for
	breaking down page content into a card structure where possible 
•	Can show example on programs page
o	(content and many images are from the original macewan site)
o	Once we had our design in mind, 
	searched through themes that would be appropriate for an educational institution and found one that best fit our wireframe and overall look of the site that we were going for
o	chose one and created a child theme, could make custom changes
o	lord will give more details about the theme and how it works later
o	mentioned earlier, it was important to update colors – previously the site used sad, dull red, and to be modern and engaging, we decided to update the colors to something brighter and warmer
	also minimize the teal color, which just didn’t go well with the red for me
	only used for links
	example: residence page
•	going to turn it over to Lord to talk about the content of the site and the theme in more detail
